# So long
## Overview
This project involves developing a small 2D game using a minimal graphics library to render sprites. The objective of the game is to collect all the collectibles scattered throughout the map while navigating with limited vision. As the player gathers more coins, their field of vision gradually expands. The player must avoid being detected by patrolling enemy, which will begin to chase the player if they get too close. Once all collectibles have been gathered, the player must reach the exit point to complete the game.
